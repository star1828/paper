But defining what it means to be a good parent is undoubtedly very <u>  1  </u>, particularly since children respond differently to the same style of parenting. A calm, rule-following child might respond better to a different sort of parenting than, <u>  2  </u>, a younger one.</p><p><u>  3  </u>,there&#39;s another sort of parent that&#39;s easier to <u>  4  </u>: a patient parent.Children of every age benefit from patient parenting. Still, <u>  5  </u> every parent would like to be patient, this is no easy <u>  6  </u>. Sometimes, parents get exhausted and are unable to maintain a <u>  7  </u> style with their kids. I understand this.</p><p>You&#39;re only human, and sometimes your kids can <u>  8  </u> you just a little too far.And then the <u>  9  </u> happens: You lose your patience and either scream at your kids or say something that was too <u>  1  </u>0 and does nobody any good. You wish that you could <u>  11  </u> the clock and start over. We&#39;ve all been there.</p><p><u>  12  </u>, even though it&#39;s common, it&#39;s vital to keep in mind that in a single moment of fatigue, you can say something to your child that you may <u>  13  </u> for a long time. This may not only do damage to your relationship with your child but also <u>  14  </u> your child&#39;s self-esteem.</p><p>If you consistently lose your <u>  15  </u> with your kids, then you are modeling a lack of emotional control for your kids. We are all becoming increasingly aware of the <u>  16  </u> of modeling patience for the younger generation. This is a skill that will help them all throughout life. In fact, the ability to maintain emotional control when <u>  17  </u> by stress is one of the most significant of all life&#39;s skills.</p><p>Certainly, it&#39;s <u>  18  </u> to maintain patience at all times with your kids. A more practical goal is to try to be as calm as you can when faced with <u>  19  </u> situations involving your children. I can promise you this: As a result of working toward this goal,you and your children will benefit and <u>  20  </u> from stressful moments feeling better physically and emotionally.</p>',7),r=[i];function s(l,u){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const c=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","cloze.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
