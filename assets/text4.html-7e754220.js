Gen Zs are about to hit thestreets looking for work in a labor market that&#39;s tighter than it&#39;s been in decades. Andemployers are planning on hiring about 17 percent more new graduates for jobs in the U.Sthis year than last, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Collegerand Employers. Everybody wants to know how the people who will soon inhabit thoseempty office cubicles will differ from those who came before them.</p><p>If“ entitled”is the most common adjective, fairly or not, applied to millennials( those born between 1981 and 1995), the catchwords for Generation Z arepractical and cautious. According to the career counselors and experts who studythem,Generation Zs are clear-eyed, economic pragmatists. Despite graduatinginto the best economy in the past 50 years, Gen Zs know what an economic trainwreck looks like. They were impressionable kids during the crash of 2008, whenmany of their parents lost their jobs or their life savings or both. They arentinterested in taking any chances. The booming economy seems to have done little to <u>assuage</u> this underlying generational sense of anxious urgency, especially for thosewho have college debt. College loan balances in the U.S. now stand at a record $1.5 trillion,according to the Federal Reserve.</p><p>One survey from Accenture found that 88 percent of graduating seniors this yealchose their major with a job in mind, In a 2019 survey of University of Georgia studentsmeanwhile, the career office found the most desirable trait in a future employer was thebility to offer secure employment (followed by professional development and trainingand then inspiring purpose). Job security or stability was the second most important careegoal (work-life balance was number one), followed by a sense of being dedicated to a causeor to feel good about serving the greater good.</p><p>That&#39;s a big change from the previous generation. “ Millennials wantcd moreflexibility in their lives,” notes Tanya Michelsen, Associate Director of YouthSight,aUK-based brand manager that conducts regular 60-day surveys of British youth, infindings that might just as well apply to American youth. “ Generation Zs are lookingfor more certainty and stability, because of the rise of the gig economy. They havetroubles seeing a financial future and they are quite risk averse.&quot;</p><ol start="36"><li><p>Generation Zs graduating college this spring _________.<br> [A] are recognized for their abilities<br> [B] are in favor of job offers<br> [C] are optimistic about the labor market<br> [D] are drawing growing public attention</p></li><li><p>Generation Zs are keenly aware _________.<br> [A] what a tough economic situation is like<br> [B] what their parents expect of them<br> [C] how they differ from past generations<br> [D] I how valuable a counselors advice is</p></li><li><p>The word “assuage&quot;(line 9, para 2)is closet in meaning to _________.<br> [A] define<br> [B] relieve<br> [C] maintain<br> [D] deepen</p></li><li><p>It can be learned from Paragraph 3 that Generation Zs _________.<br> [A] care little about their job performance<br> [B] give top priority to professional training<br> [C] think it hard to achieve work-Life balance<br> [D] have a clear idea about their future job</p></li><li><p>Michelsen thinks that compared with millennials, Generation Zs are _________.<br> [A] less realistic<br> [B] less adventurous<br> [C] more diligent<br> [D] more generous</p></li></ol>',6),n=[r];function s(l,h){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const b=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","text4.html.vue"]]);export{b as default};
